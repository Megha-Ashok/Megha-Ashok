## Hi! üëã

 I‚Äôm Megha Ashok Rabagannavar, a passionate and driven Computer Science student at JSS Science and Technology University, Mysore, currently in my pre-final year (B.E. CSE, Batch 2026).

I aspire to become a skilled Software Engineer who contributes to solving real-world problems through technology. I'm eager to work with experienced professionals in the tech industry to deepen my technical knowledge and gain hands-on experience.

My goal is to understand how engineering solutions are applied at scale and contribute meaningfully to innovations that support national growth and development. I believe in the power of continuous learning and collaborative problem-solving to make a lasting impact.

## About Me

I‚Äôm currently pursuing my B.E. in Computer Science at JSS Science and Technology University, Mysore. I‚Äôm passionate about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and enjoy solving challenging problems that sharpen my analytical and logical thinking.

My journey in tech is driven by a curiosity to explore different technologies and a strong foundation in DSA, which I apply to build efficient, scalable solutions. I actively practice coding on platforms like LeetCode to strengthen my problem-solving skills.

Alongside this, I‚Äôm exploring areas like Machine Learning, MLOps, and Web Development, aiming to combine algorithmic thinking with real-world software engineering. I believe in using tech not just to build ‚Äî but to solve, improve, and impact.
